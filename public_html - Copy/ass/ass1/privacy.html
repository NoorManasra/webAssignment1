    <h2>Customer Data Privacy Policy</h2>
    <h3>Category: Terms of Use</h3>

    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        Saturn is committed to upholding the Data Protection principles of good practice. Protecting your privacy is important to us, and we strive to keep all information relating to you confidential in accordance with this statement and the law. As part of the normal operation of our services, you may voluntarily provide us with information about yourself. The purpose of this Data Privacy Policy is to explain what personal data we collect about you, how that personal data might be used, and how we protect your personal data and privacy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Saturn is a member of STAR (the Society of Ticket Agents and Retailers), which requires Saturn to comply with an industry Code of Practice. Saturn also uses the latest extended validation security (EV SSL) certificate and is PCI DSS compliant, ensuring that tickets are sold in a safe and secure environment.
    </p>

    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
    <p>
        Saturn is an online ticketing software provider. We have been contracted by the Event Organiser to deliver online ticketing services on their behalf. Therefore, Saturn is the Data Processor acting on behalf of the Event Organiser, who is the Data Controller, and it is the Event Organiser who decides what happens to your Personal Data.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the legal basis for processing your personal data?</h3>
    <p>
        Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract (i.e., the processing of ticket bookings on behalf of the Event Organiser or storing your information if you choose to join a waiting list for an event) and legitimate interest (storage of IP Addresses for risk management or Cookies to allow full access and smooth progression through our website).
    </p>

    <h3>How do we process your personal data?</h3>
    <p>
        Saturn complies with its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) by keeping personal data up to date; by storing and destroying it securely; by not collecting or retaining unnecessary data; by protecting personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, and disclosure; and by ensuring that appropriate technical measures are in place to protect personal data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Saturn only collects personal information about you when you specifically provide us with such information voluntarily. The information that we collect includes:

        <li>To assist you with any query that you may have with your booking or payment</li>
        <li>To place you on a waiting list for a sold-out event at your request and send updates as tickets become available.</li>
        <li>We may also use your data to perform quality assurance, sales analysis, or other business analyses.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>Marketing Activities</h3>
    <p>
        During the booking process, the Event Organiser will ask if you would like to be included on their mailing list or that of other named Third Parties. If you decide to opt into these marketing lists, you agree that the Event Organiser or named Third Party can send you marketing information until such a time that you indicate to them a preference not to receive further information.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Event Organiser is responsible for their own compliance with Data Protection laws, and you agree that Saturn is not responsible for the actions of the Event Organiser concerning your personal data.
    </p>

    <h3>How long do we keep your Personal Data?</h3>
    <p>
        Saturn will keep your Personal Data for no longer than reasonably necessary and will be deleted after one (1) year. Personal Data is retained by Saturn for this period to assist us in responding to customer booking queries or any charge disputes that may arise.
